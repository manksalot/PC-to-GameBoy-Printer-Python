# PC-to-GameBoy-Printer-Python
Raphael Boichot's Matlab PC-to-Game-Boy-Printer interface converted to Python. With a few extras, I thought it would be more intuitive.

## Running the Program

There are two ways to run the program: from the Python source code or as an executable (EXE).

### Running in VS Code
1. **Install Required Libraries**: Use the following command to install the necessary libraries. Note: this is in the Python-Support-files/Python-requirements.txt:
    ```bash
    pip install pyserial numpy pillow matplotlib opencv-python scipy pyinstaller
    ```
   **Run the Program**: Ensure all files are in the same directory and execute `PC_Gameboy_Printer.py` in VS Code. Remember to include the ICO file from the Python-Support-Files folder.

   **Note**: Include the ICO file from the Python-Support-Files folder in the same folder as the `.py` files.

### Running as an EXE
0. A Windows executable is provided in [dist](https://github.com/manksalot/PC-to-GameBoy-Printer-Python/tree/main/Python/dist). Due to Github upload limits it is split using 7zip; use 7zip to unpack.

1. You must install PyInstaller by running this command:

    ```bash
    pip install pyinstaller
    ```

   **Note**: This should be included in the mentioned `.txt` file.

2. **Create the EXE**: In the same folder as the Python files, run:

    ```bash
    pyinstaller --onefile --icon=gameboy.ico --noconsole --add-data "gameboy.ico;." --add-data "Print_Image.py;." --add-data "Send_Packet.py;." --add-data "Add_CheckSum.py;." --add-data "AutoDetectCom.py;." --add-data "Image_Rectifier.py;." --hidden-import "scipy._lib.array_api_compat.numpy.fft" PC_Gameboy_Printer.py
    ```
    Note: This will generate a `dist` folder containing the EXE.
   
## GUI
This is the program's GUI. The program will start with a fixed window size and a blank spot above the GUI buttons.
The GUI window will automatically adjust the window size to the loaded picture.

*The program's GUI interface.*

-There are three options for the GUI buttons: loading the picture, feeding the paper, and printing the image.

While running the program, every time you click the feed or print button, it will auto-detect the COM the Arduino uses and create a serial connection.
It will also handle closing the COM port used. This ensures a clean disconnect and prevents erroring out or having a COM Port Leak.

When you start a print, another window displays a converted version of the selected image. This image has been resized and oriented to achieve the best ratio. Finally, a dithering process converts the image to hex data, which is stored and sent to the Arduino as packets. Each red rectangle represents a section of the image the printer is printing.

-Here is the image scan window.

## Arduino Setup and Walkthrough.
For the Arduino, use the .ino file for the sketch code. This will be in the Arduino_Nano_GB_Printer_Interface. Folder inside the .ino that you will load into the Arduino Board.
-NOTE: this will work for both Nano and Uno boards, but you might have to change the SDA SCL pins if you want to use an OLED on a Uno. The OLED I use is a 128 x 32-pixel.

## Arduino Setup
-Here is the completed device. This has an Arduino Nano, a 128x32-pixel OLED, and a custom break-out board "BOB."

## Visuals
-When the Arduino boots, you will see a booting screen and a standby screen indicating that the device is ready.

## Data Transfer
-Here, each packet sent to the printer is shown. Each packet represents the red rectangle with the data of each image section.
